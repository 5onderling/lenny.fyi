> You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned. Look around you. Did you think these people made a plan to sleep in the sports hall with you? But here we are now, sleeeping together on the floor. So, there's no need for a plan. You can't go wrong with no plans. We don't need to make a plan for anything. It doesn't matter what will happen next. Even if the country gets destroyed or sold out, nobody cares. Got it?

# {{ title }} me

Hello i'm Lenny Anders, a frontend developer based in Kürten, Germany. I startet learning developing in 2015 with basic HTML and CSS, fell since then in love with it, and never stopped learning.

I am currently training as a IT specialist for application development at Oevermann, with the focus on frontend web development.

In my freetime i'm currently learning a lot about accessibility and HTML markup in general.

When i'm not programming (what rarely happens), i probably watch a great piece of audio-visual entertainment, listen to fantastic music, browse through reddit/twitter or enjoy really good art.

## My skills

Over the time i learned a few things, i mostly like writing vanilla JavaScript (ES6), CSS with PostCSS or SCSS, HTML5 and Vue. For bundling i like to use Rollup or Webpack.

_Here's a fancy list of things i can do / use (well):_

- CSS / SASS / SCSS / PostCSS
- JavaScript (up to ES6)
- Rollup / Webpack / Gulp
- Vue / Svelte / Mithril / jQuery
- Node / npm
